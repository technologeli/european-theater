# Battle of Kursk

**Date**: July 5, 1943 - August 23 1943

## Objective

On the eastern front, the Germans wished to control the Kursk salient, a USSR-held location between German-held Orel and Belgorod. The USSR was able to prepare for such an attack, increasing their defenses and preparing for an immediate counteroffensive.

## Where and When

On July 5, 1943, the German army attacked from two sides, the north stalling quickly and the south making slow headway. On July 11, 1943, a battle ensued in Prokhorovka, southeast of Kursk. From July 12, 1943 to August 18, 1943, the USSR led counteroffensives into German territory.

## Fighting

The Soviet defenses were incredibly fortified, preventing the German offense from making conclusive progress. During the battle in Prokhorovka, over 1,200 tanks were involved and the German forces were heavily damaged. In total, there were about 500,000 German casualties and 850,000 Soviet casualties.

## Outcomes and Significance

The Battle of Kursk demonstrated the now extremely coordinated Soviet military, giving experience on multifront operations and rapid counter offensives. Additionally, the strategic momentum of the eastern front was now entirely in the USSRâ€™s hands.
