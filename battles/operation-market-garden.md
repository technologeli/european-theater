# Operation Market Garden

**Date**: September 17, 1944 - September 26, 1944

## Objective

After a successful landing in Normandy, the Allies needed a route across the Rhine River. Operation Market Garden was an attempt to capture Dutch bridges to establish such a route.

## Where and When

The operation began on September 17, and the Allies stopped the operation on September 26. Arnhem, a German-held city in the Netherlands, was one of the main targets of the operation.

## Fighting

The failure of Operation Market Garden was not due to fighting, but rather due to planning. While the Allies had an initial advantage, multiple factors contributed to the operation’s failure. First, the Allied air forces did not have enough resources to move the entire division all at once, requiring more time and removing any hope of a surprise attack. Second, the German opposition recovered a fallen Allied paratrooper’s body, which had documents that contained information about the objective of the operation. Third, while on the retreat, the top two commanders were separated from the rest of the Allied military, without a chain of command to fill in for them. These three failures led to the failure of the operation.

## Outcomes and Significance

Due to these planning failures, the Allies suffered a costly defeat and loss of many troops. Additionally, the Allies were not able to obtain a route across the Rhine River from this operation.
