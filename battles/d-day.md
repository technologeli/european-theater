# D-Day

**Date**: June 6, 1944

## Objective

With the USSR fighting a brutal eastern front, and the Italian front at a standstill, the Allies needed to focus on other methods of winning the war and to assist the USSR, which was suffering immense casualties that it could not maintain for an extended period of time. Additionally, the USSR was pressuring Britain and the United States to create a western Front to solve both of the aforementioned problems.

The Allies began planning this invasion for 1944, with Dwight D. Eisenhower at the helm and Bernard Montgomery on the ground. For a location, they chose the beaches of Normandy, not too close to Germany and not too close to the Atlantic Ocean, but still close enough to Britain to get support from the Royal Air Force. Additionally, the Allies decided that while capturing a major port would be a strategic benefit, it would be too difficult, as German defenses would be stronger there.

## Where and When

The beaches of Normandy were split into 5 sections, each with a codename. The Americans would land on Omaha and Utah, the Canadians at Juno, and the British at Sword and Gold. Though the invasion was scheduled for June 5, dangerous weather prevented the Allies from invading. The Germans knew this and relaxed; the commander Erwin Rommel even went home to Germany. However, the Allies predicted the weather would calm down just long enough to initiate the invasion. Eisenhower decided, then, to invade on June 6.

## Fighting

Because they were in control of northern France for so long, the Germans had established a coastal defense line known as the Atlantic Wall. This included artillery, anti aircraft and anti tank weapons, and concrete fortifications surrounded in barbed wire. The coast was lined with millions of explosive mines and other obstacles that made invasion difficult.

The invasion was divided into multiple phases. The first was an airborne attack from the rear, where airborne troops landed behind the Atlantic Wall to distract and surround the defense line. The second phase was a massive bombardment from the American and British air forces and navies, using more than 10 million pounds of bombs and naval artillery. The third phase involved the troops landing on the shores. This landing was brutal, and some troops never made it to shore, let alone make it up the beaches. However, four of the five beaches succeeded in the invasion. The Americans at Omaha beach, however, were initially unsuccessful, resulting in over 3,000 casualties. By nightfall, however, all five beaches were in the Alliesâ€™ hands.

## Outcomes and Significance

The Allies had successfully opened a western front, and had control of a shore on the continent of Europe. This shore would provide a landing point for the Allied military, allowing aircraft, ships, and troops to all land and resupply. This also diverted the German forces from the USSR, which up until this point was their primary focus. In total, D-Day opened not only a western front but a new path towards Allied victory.
