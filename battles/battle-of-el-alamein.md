# El Alamein

**Date**: October 23, 1942 - November 4, 1942

## Objective

The German-Italian force of the Afrika Korps were winning in North Africa and were pushing towards the Middle East. The British Eighth Army prepared a defense in El Alamein, the last location before the city of Alexandria that could not be outflanked because of its geography: to the south, the Qattara Depression, and to the north, the Mediterranean Sea. To improve a demoralized army, Winston Churchill instated Bernard L. Montgomery as commander.

## Where and When

The battle was set in three phases. The first phase began on October 23, 1942, the Eighth Army attacked the Afrika Korps. From October 26, 1942 to October 31, 1942, Montgomery employed the use of artillery. The final phase began on November 1, 1941, which forced the Afrika Korps to retreat.

## Fighting

Montgomery took control of the demoralized Eighth Army and turned it into a successful military force. During the first phrase, the Eighth Army attacked from both the center and the south. During the second phase, extreme artillery waged a war of attrition against the Axis force. Finally, during the third phase, the Eighth Army surrounded the Afrika Korps with only the mechanized divisions escaping.

## Outcomes and Significance

Bernard L. Montgomery, who had no desert experience, successfully repelled the Axis force from the Middle East and would later lead the British during the invasion of Normandy. Additionally, Operation Torch was able to land in Morocco and Algeria, leading to the loss of Axis control in North Africa.
