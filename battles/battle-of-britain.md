# The Battle of Britain

**Date**: July 10, 1940 - November 1940

## Objective

After Germany had invaded France, it wanted to force Britain out of the war. Adolf Hitler’s goal was to crush the British navy and Royal Air Force, destroy British morale, cause a British revolution, and eventually invade the country.

## Where and When

From July 10, 1940 to November 1940, the Luftwaffe, or German air force, attempted to destroy various targets in Britain, including not only British Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields and other military bases, but also civilian buildings.

## Fighting

While the German army was strong, their navy was not comparable to the British navy. To get across the English Channel, Germany sent its Luftwaffe, or air force, in an attempt to British ports. This proved unsuccessful, so the Luftwaffe targeted factories and other military bases. This also proved unsuccessful, so they began targeting the RAF. With winter coming soon, they shifted once more, towards London, with the sole intention of civilian bombings. This came to be known as “The Blitz,” which resulted in 40,000 Londoner deaths. These bombings were brutal; a survivor in a bombed shelter described it as “bodies, limbs, blood, and flesh mingled with little hats, coats, and shoes and all the small necessities which people took to the shelters with them.”

## Outcomes and Significance

40,000 British civilians died, but Germany did not shatter Britain’s morale nor did they succeed in weakening Britain enough for an invasion. This was the first time that the German military was defeated in World War II, a major turning point over the course of the war.
