# Battle of Monte Cassino

**Date**: January 17, 1944 - May 18, 1944

## Objective

The Allies, having full control of North Africa, set their sights on Italy. However, the Gustav Line, a line of Axis defense, proved to be difficult to overcome, and so in January of 1944, the Allied forces went around it and landed in Anzio. However, the Gustav Line remained, with Monte Cassino, an abbey turned into a military fortification, as a major point of defense.

## Where and When

The Monte Cassino was a mountaintop abbey, and the Allies made four separate attempts to capture or destroy the fortification. The first three failed, but the fourth, which ended on May 18, 1944, succeeded.

## Fighting

Across the four attempts, over a thousand tons of bombs were dropped on the monastery, but the Germans continued to hold on. In the last week of fighting alone, the Allies suffered more than eight thousand casualties.

## Outcomes and Significance

The Germans abandoned Monte Cassino, causing the Gustav Line to fall. As a result, the Allies were able to take control of Rome on June 4, 1944. However, the difficulty of progressing into northern Italy proved too much, and the Allies began to focus on other methods of winning the war.
