# German Invasion of Poland

**Date**: September 1, 1939 - September 27, 1939

## Objective

Germany wanted to create Lebensraum (living space) and to control territory where there were ethnically German people. After the Treaty of Versailles, Poland came into existence and received Danzig, formerly a German port city. The treaty also separated German East Prussia from the rest of Germany. Because of this, Germany wished to connect East Prussia and reclaim control of Danzig and other formerly German territory.

Additionally, the Nazi-Soviet Pact, a non-aggression agreement between Germany and the USSR, had been signed on August 23, 1939, which guaranteed the division of Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, and neutrality between the agreeing countries. This ensured that, at least for the beginning of the upcoming war, Germany would not have to deal with two fronts at the same time.

## Where and When

Germany invaded Poland along the border starting September 1, 1939 and took control of Warsaw on September 15, 1939. On September 17, the USSR entered Poland along the east border. On September 27, 1939, Warsaw surrendered.

## Fighting

While Poland did resist, the German strategy of Blitzkrieg (lightning war) proved to be too much. The speed of Germanyâ€™s airplanes, tanks, and infantry quickly outmatched the Polish cavalry and other military units.

## Outcomes and Significance

Germany quickly and successfully took control of west Poland, and did not have an eastern front on its hands at the beginning of World War II. France and Great Britain, formerly following the strategy of appeasement, found this to be too much and declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, two days after Germany first invaded Poland. While Germany had been accumulating territory prior to this invasion, the invasion of Poland was one of the key events that started World War II.
