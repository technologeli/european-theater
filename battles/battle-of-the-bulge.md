# Battle of the Bulge

**Date**: December 16, 1944 - January 16, 1945

## Objective

Germany wanted to disrupt the Allies’ communication by seizing Liege and Antwerp. This offensive, a plan directly from Adolf Hitler, was intended to stop the Allies from progressing further east. Hitler hoped that through this operation he could negotiate a truce on the western front to focus on the eastern front.

## Where and When

During the first week of the offensive, the German forces pushed into Belgium. The next week, however, they stopped making progress, and began a retreat, continuing into January.

## Fighting

The Germans collected as much offensive firepower as possible for this operation, with three armies amounting to a third of a million men, and almost a thousand tanks. However, the Allied resistance to the offensive slowed the Germans down immensely, and the Axis forces never reached the Meuse River, let alone Liege and Antwerp. The Allied forces not only outmaneuvered but also outmanned every German attempt towards their objectives.

## Outcomes and Significance

This was Germany’s desperate last attempt at an offensive, and it failed quickly and fatally. Almost a hundred thousand German troops and about half of their armored vehicles were lost. Though not as much as Germany, Americans also suffered severely with over 60,000 casualties. While there was no large territorial gain or loss from this battle, it undoubtedly led to a sooner end to World War II in Europe, as Germany had used most of their remaining resources on this offensive and lost a significant portion of them.
