# German Surrender

**Date**: May 7, 1945

## Objective

With the USSR coming from the east and the other Allies approaching from the west, Germany was quickly collapsing. Adolf Hitler refused to surrender, so the Allies continued to push towards Berlin, the capital of Germany.

## Where and When

The USSR launched an offensive on January 12, 1945, bringing them into German territory in March. On March 7, the Americans crossed the Rhine. The two parts of the Allies met outside Berlin and began their assault on the capital. On April 30, 1945, Adolf Hitler committed suicide, and Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945.

## Fighting

Though Germany resisted, there was little they could do against the still strong Allied forces. Hitlerâ€™s orders also forced more casualties than necessary, as Germans were ordered to continue to defend lost positions.

## Outcomes and Significance

The surrender of Germany put an end to World War II in Europe. The Allies began to liberate German concentration camps and plan for what post-World War II Europe would look like. The Allies, especially the United States and the USSR, were able to focus on the Pacific Theater, looking to stop the last remaining Axis power of Japan.
