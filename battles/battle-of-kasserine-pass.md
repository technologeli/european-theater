# Battle of Kasserine Pass

**Date**: January 30, 1943 - February 25, 1943

## Objective

After the defeat at El Alamein, the German-Italian force attempted to defend Tunisia, the last part of North Africa under Axis control, and began an offensive of the recently arrived French and American troops to the west.

## Where and When

On January 30, 1943, the German-Italian force took the Faïd Pass from the French. On February 14, 1943, they isolated American forces on the Lessouda and Ksaira hills, and at Sidi bou Zid the Americans suffered a large loss of armored equipment. Finally, the Allies left Gafsa, Fériana, and Thélepte, being forced out of Sbeïtla.

On February 19, 1943, the Axis powers attempted to force the Allies to leave Tunisia by sending troops through the Kasserine Pass. However, the Allies defended this pass, forcing the Axis powers to retreat from the pass and eventually North Africa. The Allies did not know this, and discovered the German-Italian force absent from the pass on February 25, 1943.

## Fighting

Though the British forces from El Alamein had been victorious, the American and French forces were not prepared for the German-Italian military. The Americans were not experienced and the French did not have modern weaponry, but were able to still defend the Kasserine Pass.

## Outcomes and Significance

Having learned their lesson, the French updated their weaponry and the Americans restructured their training, allowing them to be better equipped to eventually remove the Axis powers from North Africa, and be better prepared for retaking Europe during the invasion of Normandy.
