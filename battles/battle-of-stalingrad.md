# Battle of Stalingrad

**Date**: August 23, 1942 - February 2, 1943

## Objective

In June, the German military set their sights on the USSR, breaking the non-aggression pact signed at the start of World War II. Though the Germans were progressing deeper into Soviet territory, they were far behind schedule by August. Their goal was to eliminate the USSR before the United States entered the war. One of the key targets, not only to resupply but also to damage the USSR, was Stalingrad, an industrial city.

## Where and When

On August 23, 1942, the Luftwaffe (German air force) and the German army attacked Stalingrad, laying siege. However, neither side was willing to retreat, and the Soviets moved resources away from the city prior. After over 150 days, the USSR retaliated and isolated the German army, causing them to all surrender by February 2, 1943.

## Fighting

The Battle of Stalingrad was violent and brutal. Initially, combat was bloody and destroyed much of the city. As the battle continued into the winter, the environment and lack of resources began to become deadly. As many as two million people were lost during the battle, or almost ten thousand a day.

## Outcomes and Significance

This was one of the major turning points in World War II, as the Germans began to retreat from the east. It was a major loss to Germany, and began a series of territorial losses that would result in Germanyâ€™s eventual surrender. Additionally, the Battle of Stalingrad served as a horrifying demonstration of modern war, and to the USSR, an example of courage and heroism.
